## Build

On Windows 10/11, run `py2exe.bat`, then find `folder2osz.exe` in the `dist` folder.

## Usage

Copy-and-paste `folder2osz.exe` into a folder of decompiled *osu!* beatmaps and run it. The program will create a `.osz` file for every folder and subfolder that contains a `.osu` file. Files generated from subfolders will be placed in the same folder as the map.

The `.osz` files will be named after the folder they were created from. If you're downloading beatmaps from an online source, the folder will usually be named after the map.
